            <h3>I like to master something every day</h3>
            <p>
                I like music, photography, football, and web design because they help me to be a happier person, but I
                am
                not
                bound by the four topics. I also learn new things every day. Likewise, I like to travel to the mountains
                because
                at the top of the mountain I can keep a close eye on the sky and I can see a great view of the forest. I
                love my
                family and friends. They are always by my side.
            </p>
